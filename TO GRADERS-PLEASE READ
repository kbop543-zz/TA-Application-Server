Hi,
Just wanted to give you an overview of what I have done.

-I have made my website responsive on screens below 600 px and more.
-I have made sure to validate the data on the server side by checking if the status are the ones specified on the handout 
-I have made sure to validate the data on the server side by checking if the course exists through the course.json file
- Put constraints on the student number to be a number so relevant error messages pop up if the format isn't matched.
- I put number only constraints on year, rank, experience to validate, so relevant error messages pop up if the format isn't matched. 
-I made sure that when the user enters ANYTHING that it is case sensitive
-Made every button toggle
-Checked on empty input for all text given responses
-Made it very easy to understand and read
